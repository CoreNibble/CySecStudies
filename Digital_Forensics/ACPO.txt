Principles

Principle 1: No action taken by law enforcement agencies, persons employed within those agencies
or their agents should change data which may subsequently be relied upon in court.

Principle 2: In circumstances where a person finds it necessary to access original data, that person
must be competent to do so and be able to give evidence explaining the relevance and the
implications of their actions.

Principle 3: An audit trail or other record of all processes applied to digital evidence should be
created and preserved. An independent third party should be able to examine those processes and
achieve the same result.

Principle 4: The person in charge of the investigation has overall responsibility for ensuring that the law and these principles are adhered to.
