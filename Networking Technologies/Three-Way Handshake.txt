Three-Way Handshake

SYN (Synchronize)
During this stage, the client will send a SYN packet to the server. This is done to request the start of a connection. In this packet, there will be an initial sequence number, which is included to keep track of the data.

SYN-ACK (Synchronize Acknowledge)
During this stage, the server responds to the SYN request with a SYN-ACK. This is done to acknowledge the request to start a connection. The server also includes its own sequence number in this response.

ACK (Acknowledge)
At this stage, the client will send a final acknowledgement (ACK) packet to confirm that they have received the SYN-ACK. 
Once this three-way handshake has been completed, the data transfer can begin.

Notes:

The Three-Way Handshake occurs when the TCP protocol is used.
It occurs during the encapsulation process and thus is initiated at the Transport Layer of the OSI Model, Layer 4.
Will not occur during the decapsulation process as the connection has already been established.
