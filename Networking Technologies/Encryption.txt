Encryption  

Symmetric The use of the same key for encryption and decryption 
In order for this to work both the sender and receiver must have the same key, downside of this is keeping it secret
Examples of cyphers/encryption that use this method, AES, DES, 3DES

Asymmetric 
Uses a system of public and private keys, public key is shared publicly whereas the private key is stored well privately 
Data encrypted with the public key, can only be decrypted with the private key. 

Examples of cyphers/encryption that use this method, RSA, ECC

Ciphers

DES: Data Encryption Standard
3DES: Triple Data Encryption Standard
