OSI Model - Open System Interconnection Model

Whatever method works for you to remember it, phrased based etc
PDNTSPA, Seven Layers

Application (Layer 7, data is generated by the application, HTTP, FTP etc)

Presentation (Layer 6, data is encrypted, encoded and compressed at this layer. 
Encryption Types being SSL and TLS. 
encoding in the form of what file type it is, such as mp4, .txt, .pdf.

Session (Layer 5, Session ID header added, session established between sender and receiver, connection stays open till transfer is complete.)

Transport (Layer 4, encapsulation process has started, source port and destination ports added here, 
PDU is referred to as a segment at this stage and the relevant sequence numbers for each piece added here. 
Cont. Protocols used here being TCP: Transmission Control Protocol, PDU's are called segments here. UDP: User Datagram Protocol, PDUS are called datagrams here. 

Network (Layer 3, encapsulated from segments to packets here, source and destination IP addresses added here)

Data-Link (Layer 2, encapsulated from packets to frames here, source and destination MAC addresses added here)

Physical (Layer 1, frame is converted to bit stream at this stage and is sent across the medium, 
such as wi-fi and ethernet.)

Encapsualtion process goes from layer 7 to layer 1. 
Decapsulation process goes from layer 1 to layer 7.
